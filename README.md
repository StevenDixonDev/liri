## default commands

Liri can read commands from a file named random.txt located in its root folder. Run the command `liri do-what-it-says` to run the command saved in the file.

## :bookmark_tabs: Logging 

Liri writes all queries into JSON formated log files that can be referenced later.

## Concepts tackled

I wanted to get familiar with code splitting and using npm, this was the perfect project to learn about using node.js.
